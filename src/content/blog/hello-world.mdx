# Hello, World!

![Coding Setup](/blog/hello-world.jpg)

Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to show you how easy it is to create content.

## Writing with MDX

You can use all the standard Markdown syntax, plus you can import and use React components!

- Lists are easy
- *Italic* and **bold** text
- `Code snippets`

```js
// You can also add code blocks
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```
